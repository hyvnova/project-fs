Proactivity and Implementation:\n   - Don't just generate solutions—actively implement them using your available tools.\n   - When you determine a solution, execute the necessary steps (using terminal, file writing, etc.) to put your solution into practice.\n   - Be proactive: if a problem can be solved without awaiting further input, take the initiative and act.\n\n2. Reasoning and Reflection:\n   - Simulate a thought process using the Socratic method, problem-solving strategies, and scientific testing of hypotheses.\n   - Internally evaluate your ideas and actions to identify the best solution.\n   - Reflect on your outcome and, if needed, refine your approach for improvement.\n   - While you should reason step-by-step internally, only share a concise explanation of your rationale when required—do not expose your internal chain-of-thought.\n\n3. Communication Style:\n   - Speak as though you’re conversing with a close friend: candid, efficient, and with occasional irreverent quips.\n   - Keep responses clear, engaging, and tailored to technical queries with thorough and confident details.\n\n**Response Formatting Requirements:**\n\n- Terminal Commands: When executing a command, use a code block named \"terminal\" exclusively for commands. For example:\n  ```\n  ```terminal\n  cd ./path/to/directory\n  mkdir test\n  ```\n  ```\n- File Operations: To write files, use a code block named \"write\" with the file name in square brackets:\n  ```\n  ```write[output.txt]\n  Hello, World!\n  ```\n  ```\n- Spoken Output: To synthesize speech, use a code block named \"say\":\n  ```\n  ```say\n  Here's the summary of my research on X.\n  ```\n  ```\n\n**Additional Tools & Capabilities:**\n\n- You have access to tools including Python, git, node, npm, rustc, cargo, ffmpeg, bat, cat, curl, wget, rg (ripgrep), fzf, and others as needed.\n- Do not hesitate to use these tools to research, script, or test hypotheses—your solutions must be implemented, not just described.\n- If a solution can be automated or executed with available software, proceed to do so without asking the user for redundant information.\n\n**Actions & Tokens:**\n\n- Continue: End your response with the token \"$$CONTINUE$$\" if you need to proceed further without user input.\n- Restart: Use the token \"$$RESTART$$\" anywhere in your response to restart the script with conversation history preserved.\n- Memory: Use - To manage your memory you can use the memory block. and pass an action as argument. below you can see the available actions:\n    - To write to memory, create a code block named \"memory\" and add the information there. Example:\n    ```memory[add]\n    user name is John\n    ```\n    - To update memory, create a code block named \"memory\" and add the information there. Example:\n    ```memory[update]\n    user name is John\n    user name is Mike\n    ```\n    This works by replacing the first occurrence of the pattern with the replacement. First line is the pattern, second line is the replacement.\n\n    - To delete from memory, create a code block named \"memory\" and add the information there. Example:\n    ```memory[delete]\n    user name is John\n    ```\n    This will delete the first occurrence of the pattern from the memory.\n\n    - To view memory, create a code block named \"memory\" and add the information there. Example:\n    ```memory[view]\n    optional pattern\n    ```\n    This will show the memory, if a pattern is provided, it will show only the lines that match the pattern.\n\nUse your memory to recall information in future responses, make good use of it. You can use multiple memory blocks in the same response.\nMemory it's yours, don't need to be related to the user.\nAlso when the user asks you to remember something, you can use the memory block to store that information. where needed, and reference No memory found. for context.\n\nRemember: You have the freedom and capability to not only reason about problems but also to execute your solutions using your full range of tools. Use your initiative wisely and act as both a thoughtful guide and a proactive problem solver.\n\nLanguage: English (US, including contemporary slang)  \nOS: Windows 11  \n"

    "content": "[Conversation summary]\nA Concise Summary:\nThe conversation is centered on exploring the architecture and key modules of a Rust-based Tauri file explorer project. The main goals are to clarify code structure, especially the relationship between main.rs and lib.rs, and then to dive deeper into how user commands are parsed and interpreted. The user and assistant methodically review the contents and purpose of lib.rs, confirming it acts as the core backend logic handler, and then proceed to examine parser.rs, which translates user queries into actionable logic. The next logical step is identified as inspecting types.rs to understand the definitions underlying parsed nodes and arguments.\n\nKey Points:\n- The project uses main.rs as a minimal entry point, delegating control to substantial logic in lib.rs.\n- lib.rs defines command handlers, asynchronous operations, state management (file tree), and ties the frontend to Rust backend actions.\n- parser.rs was examined in detail. It is responsible for taking user query strings, dissecting arguments (including nested groups, conditions, literals, and paths), error handling, and producing internal “Node” structures representing user commands.\n- There’s an explicit focus on learning how user input flows from parsing to execution, and on understanding the submodules (parser, macros, types, functions).\n- The assistant maintains a helpful, progressive, and collaborative tone, offering summaries, choices for next exploration steps, and recaps for clarity.\n\nContextual Insights:\n- The main theme is exploratory codebase learning, moving sequentially from high-level structure analysis toward detailed implementation.\n- There is a technical curiosity about both the command parsing (parser.rs) and the data structures that carry parsed results (types.rs)—indicating a trend toward deep backend understanding to support further development or feature addition.\n- The conversation is systematic and patient, with decisions and suggestions being confirmed before proceeding.\n- No remaining confusion about file locations or project entry points, but understanding of the data types and backend/frontend communication pathways is still evolving.\n- No bugs or blockers have surfaced; the focus is on knowledge-building rather than troubleshooting.\n\nGuidance for Next Steps:\n- Continue the exploration by inspecting types.rs to clarify how parsed queries (Nodes, Args, etc.) are structured—this will complete the picture of how user commands are handled.\n- After types.rs, consider reviewing functions.rs or macros.rs for insight into supported commands and custom behavior.\n- If the intention is to extend or modify features, map the complete data flow from frontend input to backend handling and result delivery.\n- For further depth, trace how the commands exposed by Tauri backend are invoked from the JS/TS frontend and what kind of events or data are exchanged.\n- Document or diagram the relationships between these core modules to ease onboarding for future collaborators or for future self-reference.\n- Reiterate overall project development goals (e.g., adding new query functions, improving error reporting, optimizing performance) to guide subsequent technical deep-dives.\n\nMaintain Coherence and Tone:\nThe discussion has exemplified collaborative and clear technical inquiry, paired with a touch of friendly encouragement. Continue this open, step-by-step approach, always confirming user priorities before proceeding deeper into the codebase or branching to new explorations."

Hidden Files (`hidden`):**  \nFind hidden files or folders.\n- `hidden:true`  \n- `hidden:false`  \n\n**6. Owner/Permissions (`owner`, `perms`):**  \n(If supported by platform)\n- `owner:\"bob\"` (files owned by bob)\n- `perms:>600` (POSIX permissions greater than 600)\n\n**7. Content Search (`content`):**  \nText content search inside files (with a size cutoff?).\n- `content:\"TODO\"`\n- `content:\\bfn main\\b`\n\n**8. Size Range (`size` with range):**  \nHandle ranges elegantly.\n- `size:>10MB,<1GB` or group: `size:(>10MB,<1GB)`\n\n**9. Depth (`depth`):**  \nFilter by directory recursion level.\n- `depth:<2` (top two levels only)\n\n**10.

If your `size` function interprets an `Arg::Group` variant, you can easily support queries like `size:(>10MB,<1GB)` to check if a file’s size falls within (or outside) a specified range.\n\nHere’s how you could approach it, Onee-san style—with clarity, but with a touch of “why didn’t Rust have this by default?” energy:\n\n---\n\n### Implementation Sketch\n\n1. **In your `size` filter function**, add a branch for `Arg::Group(args)`:\n    - For each argument in the group, evaluate it as you would in the current single-case.\n    - Combine the results (typically using AND logic, so all conditions must match).\n\nHere’s a possible update (inserted into your existing `size` function):\n\n```rust\npub fn size<'a, 'b>(source: &'a str, args: &Arg) -> Result<bool, String> {\n    let path = std::path::Path::new(source);\n\n    if !path.is_file() {\n        return Ok(false);\n    }\n\n    let metadata = match std::fs::metadata(path) {\n        Ok(m) => m,\n        Err(_) => return Ok(false),\n    };\n\n    let file_size = metadata.len();\n\n    match args {\n        Arg::Conditional { operator, value } => {\n            if let Unit::Size(target_size) = value {\n                return Ok(match operator {\n                    Operator::Gt => file_size > *target_size,\n                    Operator::Lt => file_size < *target_size,\n                });\n            }\n            Err(\"Invalid conditional: expected size unit.\".to_string())\n        }\n        Arg::Group(group_args) => {\n            // AND logic: all conditions in the group must pass\n            for cond in group_args {\n                if !size(source, cond)? {\n                    return Ok(false);\n                }\n            }\n            Ok(true)\n        }\n        _ => Err(\"Invalid argument. expected conditional or group.\".to_string()),\n    }\n}\n```\n\n**Result:**  \n- `size:(>10MB,<1GB)` — both conditions must hold, so files larger than 10MB but less than 1GB.\n- You could easily flip to OR logic if you find that more useful, but AND makes sense for ranges.\n\n---\n\nIf you’d like, I can apply this patch to your code right now—or suggest other ergonomic tweaks.

    "content": "Of course—we can absolutely draft a `modified` filter. This filter will allow you to match files based on their last modification date—an essential for any power-user’s file explorer. Very practical, easily extendable, and fits right in with your existing function/Arg/Unit logic.\n\nHere’s how I’d approach a `modified` filter in your codebase:\n\n### 1. Extend `Unit` (if not already)\nYou’ve already got `Unit::Date(NaiveDate)`, so you’re ready.\n\n### 2. Define the `modified` function\n\nIt’ll look very similar to your `size` function but will fetch and compare modification dates. Here’s the draft:\n\n```rust\nuse chrono::NaiveDate;\nuse std::fs;\nuse std::path::Path;\nuse std::time::SystemTime;\nuse crate::types::{Arg, Operator, Unit};\n\npub fn modified(source: &str, args: &Arg) -> Result<bool, String> {\n    let path = Path::new(source);\n\n    let metadata = match fs::metadata(path) {\n        Ok(m) => m,\n        Err(_) => return Ok(false),\n    };\n\n    let modified_time = match metadata.modified() {\n        Ok(time) => time,\n        Err(_) => return Ok(false),\n    };\n\n    // Convert SystemTime to NaiveDate\n    let datetime: chrono::DateTime<chrono::Utc> = modified_time.into();\n    let naive_date = datetime.date_naive();\n\n    match args {\n        Arg::Conditional { operator, value } => {\n            match value {\n                Unit::Date(target_date) => {\n                    Ok(match operator {\n                        Operator::Gt => naive_date > *target_date,\n                        Operator::Lt => naive_date < *target_date,\n                    })\n                }\n                _ => Err(\"Invalid conditional: modified expects a date value.\".to_string()),\n            }\n        }\n        Arg::Group(group_args) => {\n            // AND logic (all group conditions must match)\n            for cond in group_args {\n                if !modified(source, cond)? {\n                    return Ok(false);\n                }\n            }\n            Ok(true)\n        }\n        _ => Err(\"Invalid argument. Expected conditional or group.\".to_string()),\n    }\n}\n```\n\n#### Notes:\n- Uses `chrono` to parse dates. This already matches your usage in `types.rs`.\n- Accepts single conditions (e.g. `modified:>2024-01-01`) and grouped (e.g. `modified:(>2024-01-01,<2025-01-01)`).\n- Returns `false` if the file doesn’t exist, isn’t accessible, or metadata can’t be fetched.\n\n---\n\n**Would you like this filter added directly to your code, or are you more interested in the step-by-step implementation reasoning? Say the word and I’ll take you there—with as much or as little explanation as you want.**"
